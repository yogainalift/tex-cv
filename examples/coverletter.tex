\begin{cvletter}

With reference to an advertisement on the Dayjob.com website, I am applying for the post of Front End Developer with your company.

\lettersection{About Me}
As a child, I loved connecting with people by playing games and solving puzzles. I turned my hobby into a profession and became a computer scientist. During my studies, I was interested in game-based learning. I worked on a web application for my BSc project and I realized that the core of my motivation is that my work has a societal impact. That is why I chose to work at a small company, EagleScience, to contribute to socially relevant projects. My next step was an international company, called WORTH, where I worked on an application that helps the Dutch government process visa applications for thousands of people. I was born in Greece, but I have also lived and worked in the Netherlands. As a green card holder today, I am beginning the next step of my life's journey. Still pushing to make a difference and connect with people, one interaction at a time. Inspired by this mindset, I am looking for projects that have social value.
